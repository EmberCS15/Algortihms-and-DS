/*I will be addressing the following problem: Given a fixed array A of 2N integers, we need to calculate âˆ€ x function F(x) = Sum of all A[i] such that x&i = i, i.e., i is a subset of x.*/

/*Time complexity - outer loop runs for O(nCk) times as the total number of elements with k set bits is 
equal total number of ways of arranging k 1s in n spaces which nPk/k! = nCk. 
Suppose i consists of k set bits then the total number of subsets of i are equal to O(2^k). This is becuase
in each of the k posittions (position of set bits) we can have 0 or 1 while unset bits will remain unchanged.
Therefore the total time complexity is = O(Summation over k(nCk*2^k)) = O(3^k) */
